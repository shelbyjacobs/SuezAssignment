This uses a REST endpoint to get an csv of people, sort them alphabetically by name, and then put the sorted users back to the endpoint in the form of a json.

My goal was to complete the assignment in a way that accomplishes the task without too much extra content (classes, methods, etc.). I tried to be efficient, while also writing it such that new features could be added if this project was expanded upon.
